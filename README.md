A Deep Dive into NBA game with Data Science
Data science plays a crucial role in various fields. As an NBA enthusiast, I've observed a significant shift towards data-driven approaches in game strategies, team management, and draft picks. In my final project, I am assuming the role of a data scientist working for the LA Lakers. The Lakers' General Manager (GM) has tasked me with uncovering valuable insights. I will present findings derived from data science methods and machine learning techniques to provide a comprehensive analysis for decision-making.Â¶
Here are the questions from GM:
Use data science to assess player performance and optimize contract valuations for the LA Lakers, with the aim of identifying undervalued and overvalued players?
Furthermore, Provide suggestion to make contract adjustments over the upcoming years to enhance the team's overall performance and financial efficiency?
